        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Avignon under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EYyOnEkAAAAJ&hl=fr&oi=ao">Francesco De Pellegrini</a> and <a href="https://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Eitan.Altman/">Eitan Altman</a>.
        I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Université Côte d’Azur and Inria Sophia Antipolis in 2024 under the supervision of <a href="https://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Sara.Alouf/">Sara Alouf</a> and <a href="https://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Giovanni.Neglia/">Giovanni Neglia</a>.
        My research is characterized by the application of probability theory to analyze randomized streaming and caching algorithms.
        Recently, I started working on repeated resource allocation games. More details are available in my <a href="Docs/enCV.pdf" download>CV</a>.</p>

        <h2>Ph.D. Thesis (2020–2024)</h2>
        <p><strong>Ph.D. thesis (2020–2024).</strong> My Ph.D. thesis, <em>Probabilistic Analysis for Caching</em>, provides rigorous performance guarantees for probabilistic streaming and caching algorithms. The analysis of these algorithms is complex, as it involves studying analytically intractable stochastic processes. We circumvent this difficulty by introducing novel surrogate processes that capture the real dynamics yet remain tractable. These surrogates are then analyzed with Markov-process techniques, renewal theory, concentration inequalities, or online convex optimization, yielding tight performance bounds.</p>

        <h2>Postdoc Work (2024–now)</h2>
        <p><strong>Postdoc work (2024–now).</strong> In my postdoc, I'm working on repeated games arising from the competition among agents in proportional allocation auctions. The objective is to capture the system's evolution based on agents' selfish behavior. To answer these questions, our study integrates concepts from game theory, stochastic approximation, and online convex optimization.</p>
